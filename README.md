Python - Beyond the Basics

Courseware from Pluralsight.

The teaching style is one of "growing" code, which is ok but the finished result loses the thought progression that got you there.

So, by using git hub here I can commit and track changes and keep the evolution of code.

Plus, I wanted to see how PyCharm worked with Git.  (to be fair, its ok once you get it set up.)

As a caveat, I am not really maintaining these files at all. You can get the completed files from pluralsight directly if you want; I am more interesting in saving the code evolution.
